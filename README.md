# WED - a Worse Editor
My attempt at a terrible editor that no one should ever use

## Todo
List of things I need to implement/fix in no particular order
1. Views 
    - The text is just rendered contiguously ->
    - If there are more lines than screen height or the line is longer than screen width it breaks
2. Create a new file
    - This should be as simple as checking if a file exists and if it doesnt, initialize an empty editor;
3. Only type characters that have symbols and make sure that the symbol alone is inserted
4. Way too many segfaults
    - This one is self explanatory, my code is terrible and I need it to just be better
